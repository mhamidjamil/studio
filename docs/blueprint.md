- API Request Handling: Functions to manage communication to the specified server for all the configuration endpoints using GET and/or POST methods based on the configurations specified in the form.
- Status Messaging: Uses feedback to inform the user about the status of their request, indicating success or failure through intuitive and noticeable messages or alerts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7) to symbolize control, sophistication, and the blending of digital commands with physical outputs.
- Background color: Very light violet (#F3E5F5).
- Accent color: A vivid purple (#9C27B0) that adds contrast and a sense of dynamic action to highlight interactive elements and guide the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for clear and accessible information presentation across different screen sizes, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Crisp, minimalist icons that represent LED status, color options, and setting adjustments. The goal is clarity and quick recognition.
- A split-screen layout optimized to allocate server config parameters to the top and controller parameters to the bottom for optimal user engagement.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations, such as color changes and button presses, should be incorporated for a satisfying sense of direct manipulation.
